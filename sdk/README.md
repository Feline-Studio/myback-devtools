# Myback SDK
Myback SDK is aimed to assist the development of a custom module for Myback system. It helps developers send requests to Myback backend server and act as an abstract layer between Myback backend and your custom module's code.

# Getting Started
To get started, copy files in the `/template` directory and Myback SDK and API mocker should be all installed as dependencies. Now you are good to go, the directory structure looks like a React project, with `/src/App.js` as the entry point.

# Build SDK From Source
Build from source can be done by using the `npm` system.
```bash
npm run install
npm run build
```
